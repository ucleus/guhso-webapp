**About Guhso**

Welcome to *Guhso* ‚Äî where energy meets authenticity, Jamaican flair runs wild, and real conversation doesn‚Äôt ask permission. Hosted by Sean, *Guhso* isn‚Äôt just a podcast; it‚Äôs your weekly invitation into Yardie life: "Yadie A Fareign, Bare Vibez." We talk big, laugh loud, and then we make sure you've grown by the end of every episode.

We first hit the airwaves in **October 2020**, born from the need to keep the conversation real‚Äîno filters, no corporate polish‚Äîjust raw vibes and truth from a Jamaican perspective. What started as a podcast quickly grew into a space for culture, humor, and those ‚Äúonly in yard‚Äù moments you can‚Äôt script.

Each episode is a vibey deep dive into what makes life in the yard so rich and unpredictable. Think chicken-farming wisdom with Rohan, runway stories with Kalure Beauty‚Äôs Mona, culturally charged convos with Yogi‚Äîseasoned with wit, heart, and that undeniable Jamaican spice. We're more than conversation ‚Äî we‚Äôre connection. If you‚Äôve ever wondered how raising chickens teaches you about self-reliance, how style choices reveal cultural roots, or how ‚ÄúDem Woman Ya Today‚Äù is more than just a phrase‚Äîit‚Äôs a mood‚Äî*Guhso* gives you that and then some.

We drop fresh episodes weekly, keeping pace with the rhythms of real life, real people, and real talk. No fluff, no filter‚Äîjust unapologetic vibes, solid stories, and the kind of warmth that feels like home‚Äîyard style.

But we didn‚Äôt stop there. We‚Äôve expanded the *Guhso* experience with our **blog page**‚Äîyour spot to keep in tune with what and how we think, along with our takes on life. It‚Äôs where we unpack thoughts that don‚Äôt always make it to the mic, share our views in detail, and invite you deeper into how we see the world. It‚Äôs conversation that lingers long after the episode ends.

And because we‚Äôre not just about culture‚Äîwe‚Äôre about keeping you sharp‚Äîwe also cover **selective tech** on the blog. That means no information overload, just the tech that matters to you. Whether it‚Äôs tools to level up your hustle, gadgets worth your time, or trends that actually impact your life, we curate it so you stay informed without drowning in noise.

Podcast. Blog. Culture. Tech. *Guhso* isn‚Äôt just content‚Äîit‚Äôs a movement. And we‚Äôre only getting started.
